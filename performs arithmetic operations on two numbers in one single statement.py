# Summary: This program performs arithmetic operations on two numbers in one single statement

# ToDo:
# 1. Ask user for two numbers and store in variables
# 2. Perform arithmetic operations on numbers and store in variables (in one single statement)
# 3. Print results in one single statement

'''

# Perform arithmetic operations on numbers and store in variables (in one single statement)
# add, sub, mul, div, mod, exp
add,sub,mul,div,mod,exp = num1 + num2 , num1 - num2 , num1 * num2 , num1 / num2 , num1 % num2 , num1 ** num2

# Print results in one single statement
print("the ans of add is " , add)
